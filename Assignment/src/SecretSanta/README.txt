Populate Families.txt, Names.txt, and ThreeYears.txt with names that will be assigned.  Run BaseClass.java to create the assignments. 

Using the ThreeYears.txt any specific constraint can be entered and will be automatically taken care of. 
Also, the program is designed such that "FlagMatrix" is populated to have ALL specified constraints. Any additional constraints will
only involve changing the assignment of the "FlagMatrix", but the rest of the program need not be alterted in any way.
